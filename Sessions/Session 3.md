summary: After Doji Junji won his duel, the party traveled to Tochigi and arrived at the estate of Daidoji Haruki, the local governor. Haruki revealed that Seppun Ayumu was hosting a major tournament in town and showed the group the ceremonial swords of Seppun Daiori, raising concerns of an impending assassination. That night, the swords were stolen by a skilled thief, leaving Haruki distraught and evidence pointing toward Matsu Samano, lord of Wachimasu.

## Overview

### Haruki's Estate
Doji Junji won the duel against the bicth from last week. He needs to go to a blacksmith to cool off.

"***I need to lay some pipe. - Doji Junji***"

The meal this bitch was not missing anything, but her chefs barely even tried. They barely talked to us. How dishonorable.

The next morning, we had a half day travel to [[Tochigi|Tochigi]]. Eventually we come in sight of the village. There is a very obvious estate; smaller than [[Matsu Mioko]]'s estate. There is an inn where clearly a lot of people are staying; mostly Crane samurai. A fuckin rando yells at us to talk to "the boss man". This is the estate of [[Daidoji Haruki]].

We meet Haruki. He is the governor of this town. He mentions that we received a Seppun invitation. Tagashi was a bit confused, but then he realizes that that was the wrong invitation.

Seppun Ayumu is having an "event for the ages" in town. It is a tournament, and the Seppun gave him a gift. Doji Gaoxing asked about the gift.

He agrees to show the gift. They are swords of Seppun Daiori, who led the Seppun against the Scorpion a century ago. Togashi complimented the swords, given they are Scorpion relics. Gaoxing asked about the governor's usual sword. He seems like he wants to duel if he's planning on wearing this katana. This could be a classic assassination attempt.

Gaoxing writes a letter to [[Daidoji Kentarō]] that he suspects his cousin, Haruki, is definitely about to be assassinated.

### The Duel
The Lion, Hare, and Dragon agree to a friendly duel. The hare and the lion chose some wooden weapons. The Dragon went without a weapon.

The Lion knocked out the Dragon and the Hare immediately yielded. The Lion is not an opponent to be underestimated.

### The Scream

During the night, we are awoken by a scream. Akodo immediately jumps out the window for some fucking reason. He ran in to the room where the scream originated. The group sees [[Daidoji Haruki]] lying on the ground openly sobbing. In front of him is the Daijo stand, broken in half, and the swords are gone. Akodo asks haruki if he knows who would have done this.

***"Who's screaming like a little girl? - [[Kuni Yoshiuki]]***

He says, "it can only be [[Matsu Samano]]." He  is the lord of [[Wachimasu]].

Akodo notices that this was a trained thief who came in from the top windows. There are footprints leading to the stand. There are 3 long black strands of hair and a bit of blood.

After this, three cranes burst in. Two check on Haruki, and the other demands what we are doing here. Haruki explains that we are here to help.

Gaoxing finds a merchant outside named [[Hero]]. He says about an hour ago, he saw a woman running from the palace, spoke to a guard, and ran out of town.
