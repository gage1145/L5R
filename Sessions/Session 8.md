## Overview
### Making Camp
[[Koganshi Onotatsu]] let's us know that if we continue, around noon tomorrow, we will pass by [[Kogoki]]. It has a bad reputation for being filled with a bunch of disgusting bungei. I bet it lives up to its reputation.

Onotatsu asked if Yoshiyuki ever met one of the [[Izumi]].  He had both good and bad interactions with them.

The group also discussed whether we should travel to the capital city and beg forgiveness from [[Bayushi Masako]].

### [[Kyuden Bayushi]]
We arrive at the castle.
