## Overview
### Making Camp
[[Koganshi Onotatsu]] let's us know that if we continue, around noon tomorrow, we will pass by [[Kogoki]]. It has a bad reputation for being filled with a bunch of disgusting bungei. I bet it lives up to its reputation.

Onotatsu asked if Yoshiyuki ever met one of the [[Izumi]].  He had both good and bad interactions with them.

The group also discussed whether we should travel to the capital city and beg forgiveness from [[Bayushi Masako]].

### [[Kyuden Bayushi]]
We arrive at the castle. We realize there is no easy way into the castle, so we ask a nearby bushi how to get an audience with Bayushi Masako. They mention that we can brave the labyrinth. This is obviously a trap. The bushi offers to take a note to the champion, but we are skeptical of that offer.

The group argued for quite a while on whether we should stay here overnight. Hanzo argued that we should at least stay one night to show that we attempted to meet with Masako in good faith.

Gaoxing has a side conversation with Onotatsu. He wants to know the ronin's thoughts on the last few days. Onotatsu understands the difficult position he's in. He understands that he has been put in a position of peril by the knowledge he now possesses. Gaoxing asks if he prefers being a ronin rather than a true samurai. He says,

###### "If things had not ended the way they did, I would still be serving my clan."
He was tasked with defeating a tribe of Izumi that threatened a tribe in the north. His men died, and he was cursed and maimed. His mouth had been cursed shut, and he had to cut open his mouth to speak again.

Gaoxing convinces Onotatsu to join us in a more permanent manner in exchange for restoring his lost honor. Onotatsu just wants to know he performed good in the world and wants to be remembered.

Hanzo attempted to intimidate his way into a room at the inn, but failed spectacularly. Gaoxing then attempted to get a room in a more normal way by paying the man.

# Night in the castle walls
Hanzo ends up following a guard into the entrace of the labyrinth. I follow the man through almost all of the way, but lose him towards the end. I heard a passcode! I realize they are probably changing the walls day-to-day.

Togashi makes himself known and is led into the castle. He is left in the room for a couple hours. Eventually, a man comes and asks what I want. I say that [[Bayushi Nagitane]] sent me. After another few hours, I am brought before [[Bayushi Masako]]. I offer my apologies for killing his samurai, and ask for papers through Unicorn lands and into Dragon lands. He accepts.l
