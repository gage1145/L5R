## Overview
### Departing to the Steppes
Gaoxing tries to get papers from the battalion leader, [[Iuchi Monotake]]. He convinces him to sign some papers. 

The next day, we depart into the plains of Unicorn lands. It's beautiful rolling plains. We see bands of horsemen travelling in the distance. The more civilized companions feel that it is a bit "unfinished". The days are getting shorter, and the weather colder. We travel for roughly 2 hours before we make it to the village with [[Ide Chokekami]].

We were directed to the headman's house upon entering the village. We ask for Chokekami, and his eyes light up. He says she is VERY important. Close associations with the Unicorn champion, [[Shinjo Tamogen]]. He obviously doesn't know her purpose here, but she has come to visit her friend, the lord of the village. It's also uncommon that so many visitors are in the village. 

He tells us that the lord [[Iuchi Gozaiman]] is hosting her. Gozaiman welcomes us into his castle, and very quickly let's us know where Chokekami is. She is at a shrine where we can have some privacy. Inside are some mats and tea; we get saddled.

### Meeting Ide Chokekami
We give her the papers with her name on them. She's met Masako, and their relationship is certainly strained. I imply that she and the Bayushi may have common goals. Yakisoba strings a code together about picking a chrysanthemum (Seppun Haruhisa), and growing a new garden. She picks up on the metaphor, and implies that she knows about our mission to kill [[Ichiro Masakatsu]].

She received a message from [[Daidoji Kentarō]] that we would need help leaving Badger lands. She can help us with intel, but not much more. She says the Badgers are suspicious, and that Yoshiyuki will feel most at home there. There has been an exodus from Badger lands lately. The region is likely on the verge of civil war. [[Ichiro Toshekatsu]], the Badger champion may not be terribly upset if we kill this man.

The [[Path of Woe]] is the only way in and out of Badger lands, and she will be waiting there for a month or two for us to return. Togashi notices that her lord, Tamogen, may not know about her motives here.

### The Monks
Togashi and Gaoxing go to meet the monks in town. We meet [[Monowari]]. He says that the Unicorn shrines had not been visited in some time. This shrine is devoted to [[Kami Shinjo]] and [[Fortune Ibisu]]. Hanzo offers to trade some katas with the monks and they agree.

Goaxing notices that something is wrong with these monks. And no matter how hard he tries, he can not get the to say specifically where they came from. VERY SUSPICIOUS. Gaoxing returns to Ide to report his suspicions. She recommends killing them, but it is Gaoxing's choice. She will honor his decision.

Gaoxing brings up the plot to the group, and we all decide the monks must die. We try investigating their behavior, but don't notice anything. Haku brings up that there seem to be much less servants than there were originally.
