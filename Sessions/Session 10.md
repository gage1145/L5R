## Overview
### The Ogre
We start with the [[Ogre]] being shot with two arrows that didn't do much damage. Onotatsu does an initial slash at the monster across the forearm, leaving a massive gash. Doji Junji then comes in and slices off two of its fingers holding its odachi. Yakisoba carved a deep wound in its back. Blood was spilling everywhere. Junji dealt the mortal blow, slicing the ogre's throat. We were victorious.

[[Usagi Ozaki]] thanks us for his defense. He has some things he needs to talk to Usagi about. We offer to burn the bodies of his fallen companions. He tells us he was tracking an ogre bearing the hare clan symbol. He was sent by his lord to slay the monster and recover the signet.

After a brief conversation between the two hares, Ozaki  gives Haku the ogre's odachi which had the hare signet upon it. Ozaki assures us that he is safe traveling alone.

Hanzo makes sure to have a tea ceremony with the samurai before he leaves.

### Traveling North
We travel north for a few days, and one day as we're setting up camp, we notice the glow of a campfire in the twilight. Hanzo, Yakisoba, and Yoshiyuki sneak up on the camp undetected. We saw a lone woman, crying into her hands. She mumbles something into her hands and goes back to crying.

###### "Would you help me?"

She was looking for her husband who was taken by an ogre a couple days ago. Hanzo goes to retrieve the rest of the group. Her name is [[Goseki Yua]]. Her husband's name is [[Koritome Yoshiro]] She is a lion clan woman. Her parents disapproved of her marriage, so the fled west. Gaoxing notices right away that she looks very similar to his wife. The woman is obviously concerned that 5 additional men arose from the shadows.
 
Gaoxing inquires about the ogre that stole her husband. Haku asks if it was wielding the odachi we acquired. She said that the ogre in fact was wielding a massive club. The kidnapping took place 2 days ago, midday, on the 12th.

Yoshiyuki informs the group that ogres are definitely more intelligent than most other shadowland fiends. So, there is a chance her husband is still alive.

### Tracking the New Ogre
Haku finds the tracks, but insists the tracks are too regular. A ways into the marsh, there are some ruins of an abandoned village. Yakisoba and Hanzo sneak into the ruins, following the tracks. It consists of 4/5 homes that have sunk into the bog. As they moved through the reeds, they saw a shadow about 30 feet ahead. As we approach, the ground is going deeper into the water. Hanzo and Yakisoba climb one of the roofs, and they saw several other shadowy figures lurking among the reeds.

Hanzo calls out to the nearest shadow, but no response. Yakisoba throws a grappling hook at it, but can't get purchase. He tries again, and snatches it. It is a lion clan corpse. His face had been scratched off to the bone. This could possibly be a bog hag. My god, Goseki Yua IS THE BOG HAG!!!

As Yakisoba and Hanzo are running back, the group is already in melee. After a couple rounds, Onotatsu swings true, and cleaves the hag in two. Hanzo incinerated the hag's body with fire breath.

### The Edge of Unicorn Lands
We finish the last day of our journey in the rogue lands and arrive at [[Seiketsu Pass]]. Walls have been built up along the sides with tall pagoda towers. We entered and realized that this is more laughter than we have ever heard in our lives. As many as are wearing katan are wearing curved swords. It is a bit uncanny valley.

**Hanzo has no void for next session.**
