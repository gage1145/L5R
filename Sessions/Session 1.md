session: "1"
summary: "The party was inducted into the **Kyōtsū no michi**, a conspiracy to eliminate the emperor’s disgraced brother, **Seppun Haruhisa**, after learning of his crimes against the Hare Clan. They received their first directive: travel through Unicorn lands with the aid of **Daidoji Karuki** and ultimately hunt down the four members of the **Gokunishi**. Gaoxing privately proposed building a Crane information network for Kotarō. At day's end, **Bayushi Nagitane** offered documents granting safe passage through Scorpion territory. The party must decide whether to use these documents, or continue on with the original plan."

## Overview
The characters met and after making acquaintance, we were led into a chamber. We met an austere Crane, a skinny Crab with an eye patch, and an older, fit Dragon, and an ancient Lion.

We bowed and took a seat. [[Daidoji Kotarō]] addressed us. The emperor's brother is known to be deprecated. Recently he defiled the Hare clan. The second son of the Hare clan were killed because of [[Seppun Haruhisa]] (the brother).

We learned of the [[Kyōtsū no michi]], the plot to kill the emperor's brother. We are now all members of the conspiracy.

We must first visit [[Daidoji Karuki]] who will help us travel through Unicorn land into Badger lands.

Gaoxing has a moment alone with Kotaro after the group was dismissed. He believes he has the knowledge to form allies that could aid us in the task. He has an idea for a network of agents within Crane territory. He will also need a method for sending letters to Kotaro's estate.

We meet [[Bayushi Nagitane]] at the end of the day. He offers to give us papers for direct passage through Scorpion territory into Unicorn lands. On the other hand, we could pass through Hare lands, though the Hare could give us trouble.
