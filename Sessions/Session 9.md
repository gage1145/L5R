## Overview
### Outside the Inn
The crew (minus Hanzo) here footsteps outside their room. The men demand we come out. We prepare for a melee. There are half a dozen heavily armored Scorpion bushi. One in particular says, 

###### "I'd like to see your papers."

His name is [[Bayushi Ogoro]]. The man says he doesn't want agitators in [[Kyuden Bayushi]]. He demands that we tell our tale "from the beginning." Yakisoba kneels down out of respect, and explains that we were sent by [[Bayushi Nagitane]]. The guy isn't buying it and orders his men to arrest us.

### In the Castle
The papers are brought to Hanzo personally by [[Bayushi Masako]]. He invites Hanzo to the Bayushi Festival next year. We were 2 weeks late for this one. The papers are incredibly ornate. It could put a target on us. He lets Hanzo know that the rest of the crew was led into an underground dungeon.

Hanzo was led into a lightly wooded area. The bungei says, 

###### "Do your companions have a signal?"
I don't. He tells Hanzo a story about how his cousin and he had been separated after partying. In the morning he was too disoriented to find his way home. He asked one of the geisha to find his cousin. His cousin was smart enough to have already made a plan if they had been separated. His cousin looked for the nearest oak tree.

Hanzo gave him a koku in response to his entertaining story and wisdom.             

### The Man and the Pig
It quickly becomes apparent that these guards are not leading the group to the castle. The vibe seems to be that the guards are putting of mixed signals. They seem friendly at times, but are actively pushing us out at spearpoint. We are eventually brought before a man with a leashed pig. Ogoro behead the man after a short conversation where the pig farmer was becoming agitated. At the same time, one of the guards' belt fell off because Yakisoba tampered with it.

Ogoro picks up the peasant's head and grabs the leash, and returns to the group. Yakisoba had managed to sneak away, and he was upset about that. He kind of just brushed it off though. Ogoro challenged the group to a duel under the guise of comparing techniques. It becomes clear that this is to stage a murder. Two of the guards cut each other down? WTF is happening??? He tells us:

###### "run."
It is clear that the guards are setting up a scene.

### Outside Kyuden Bayushi
The group discusses whether Hanzo is still alive or will he be evicted under similar pretense. The man eludes to agitators in the land, and eludes to our fake death. Essentially, we were both here officially yet we also died here. The papers we got say we are meeting [[Ida Chokokane]] in Unicorn lands and then travelling to meet kin of Togashi Hanzo.

### Welcome to [[Ginesutra]]
We head toward the river to the west and come across the village of Ginesutra. We note that this village is lacking any bushi. Instead, there are a lot of sohei (warrior monks). The monks says that there is a sickness going around and asks if we would be willing to help move some rice in exchange for a meal and a night of sleep. We accept for a small bit of honor. Overnight, Junji and Hanzo catch the flu that is going around. Hanzo asks if we can practice our katas and spar. He says we can go to [[Shinden Osano-wo]]. He tells us of [[Osano-wo]], an ancient crab fortune for which their dojo is named. 

### Traveling North
We decided against going to the dojo, and instead headed north toward the mission. Early in the morning, the 3rd watch here some ruckus that sounds like animal sounds. Junji recognizes that one is a battle cry by a samurai. Haku starts running toward the sound. Hanzo also wakes to the sound. Haku tries sneaking up, but trips on a body wearing Hare clan armor. How ironic. Haku notices they are fighting a large looming figure that we can't quite make out. 

Haku calls out to the samurai and asks if they are also Usagi. He yells back that he is [[Usagi Ozaki]]. The monster is wielding a large sword bearing the Hare clan crest. It is an [[Ogre]].
