## Overview

### Chasing the mysterious women
We arrived at the gate where [[Hero]] told us the woman went. There is no guard here. Very suspicious. Yakisoba decided to steal a fucking horse and chase the trail, even though the trail is cold. He is riding to the next town [[Wachimasu]] which is likely where this chick went. Kuni followed on foot. Eventually Yakisoba picks Kuni up and they ride together.

Eventually, they catch a glimpse of a samurai in haggard damaged lion clan armor in moving combat. They can't catch exactly who he's fighting. Yakisoba immediately jumps off the horse to go help the guy. Kuni stays behind with his bow.

Yakisoba comes to a cave where he thinks the fighting is happening, and he hears a loud agonizing scream. Yakisoba charges in, and when inside, he hears a loud growl from a certainly gigantic animal. He also hears cackling from outside the cave entrance.

###### ***It's a bear.***

Somehow, Yakisoba throws some pepper in the [[Crane Lands Cave Bear]]'s face and runs off into the dense forest. The bear is unable to easily traverse the thick brush.

Somehow, the two make it to Wachimasu by ~3am. The guards there immediately cut up the papers from our Crane friend and demand the two leave immediately. Kuni pretends to be drunk and then swiftly strikes down one of the guards, leaving the other two. Without hesitation, Kuni dispatches another. With no help from Yakisoba, Kuni slashes the last guard leaving him bleeding out. Yakisoba spent the whole time getting off his stolen horse.

### Planning the retrieval with Daidoji-dono
Junji and the rest of the party returned to [[Daidoji Haruki]]'s estate to explain that the Akodo stole a horse. He showed disappointment in this fact, but promised us some horses in the morning.

Haruki informs Togashi that [[Matsu Samano]] is a fatass and they are constantly in competition for being the better border town. 

### Arrival in Wachimasu
When Kuni and Yakisoba arrive back in town, we notice a large plume of smoke coming from the center of town. When we get there, we found they were burning a bunch of bandit bodies.

The two are invited into the Lord's manor where they meet Matsu Samano. He goes on a tirade against the Akodo family and Crab clan whenever he gets even the slightest sense that they are blaming him for stealing the swords. After the 20 minute bitch-fest, the two make a hasty retreat and go back into town.

Finally, the rest of the party shows up.

## Key Learnings
- Clan allegiance is not a catch-all for getting out of situations.

## Who Did We Meet?
- **[[Matsu Samano]]**, [[Wachimasu]]
