## Overview

### Traveling through Scorpion Lands
Yakisoba suggests that we find the family of the ronin we just killed. The nearest city is [[Toshi Aitate]]. Junji also wants to find a bushi school to challenge someone to a duel. 

In a village on the way, the townspeople said that he had meandered into this region, and was criminally challenging people on the road. They hated him. The lord of the town was appreciative and gave us some information. Apparently, the gates of Toshi Aitate only open at night.

### The Duel of the Crane and the Scorpion

Before we left, Junji challenged the lord to a duel of first blood. My boy is being hellllllla disrespectful right now! The samurai handedly defeated our petulant crane. Given the result of this, Junji decided he didn't want to go to Toshi Aitate anymore.

### Back on the Road
Late in the afternoon, we noticed a small party of the side of the road, huddled together. It's 2 lions, a crane, and a crab. They're fucking beat to shit. The crane steps out and says

###### "Please, we are in need of aid."

The Crane woman asks us to help take revenge. Turns out they were also tasked with finding [[Lady Night]], but they lost the trail. They were hired by our lord [[Daidoji Kentarō]]. They gathered rumors that Lady Night has been in the shadow lands multiple times. They think she's a member of a Phoenix vassal. Also the prince gave [[Doji Mitsuhide]] a castle.

[[Daomatsu]] - the first Lion
[[Ikoma Iako]] - the second Lion
[[Hiruma Komoro]] - the Crab
[[Daidoji Atabashi]] - the Crane
[[Kitsune Ao]] - the dead Fox (This person ended up not existing)

We affirm that we will follow them to the shrine to exact revenge. Whoops! Turns out they tricked us and attacked us!!! We handedly defeated them.

###### "If I were you, I would beg forgiveness from [[Bayushi Masako]]." - Atabashi

Hanzo incinerated the fucker.

We found new travel papers with our names on one of the bodies to meet [[Ida Chokokane]] signed by [[Bayushi Masako]].
