## Overview
### Traveling through Scorpion Lands
Yakisoba suggests that we find the family of the ronin we just killed. The nearest city is [[Toshi Aitate]]. Junji also wants to find a bushi school to challenge someone to a duel. 

In a village on the way, the townspeople said that he had meandered into this region, and was criminally challenging people on the road. They hated him. The lord of the town was appreciative and gave us some information. Apparently, the gates of Toshi Aitate only open at night.

Before we left, Junji challenged the lord to a duel of first blood.
