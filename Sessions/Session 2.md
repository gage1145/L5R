## Overview
### The Road to the Lonely Shore
We received the papers from [[Bayushi Nagitane]] to adventure into Scorpion territory. We wake up on the 14th day of Doji.

Bayushi's handler tells us that the papers aren't necessarily needed in Scorpion territory. We could book a boat in [[Lonely Shore City]] to [[Prosperous Plains City]]. From there, we could continue to [[Daidoji Karuki]]'s village.

We discussed whether we should take the boat. Ultimately, we decided to take it.

We arrived in Lonely Shore and arrived at the docks around twilight. We find the ship; it's moderately sized. Couldn't go deep ocean, but a little ways out. Couple dozen for the crew.

Gaoxing presents his chop to the captain. The captain is poorly dressed. His name is [[Daidoji Dobunaru]]. He says we can leave in the morning.

### Figuring Out Lodging
We have to figure out a place to stay for the night. We could stay in an inn and risk dishonor by spending our own money, or we could find a local samurai to lodge us for the night. Akodo said he would fix the problem, and not to worry about it.

He goes to a local samurai named [[Kasuga Hemorei]] who does money changes. One of the guards approach him, and asks if he wants to meet the samurai. The door slides open; inside is an elaborately dressed samurai, Kasuga. He's a bit on the heavy side, looks more like a working man rather than a samurai. He comes out grinning, hands wide.

***Welcome master Lion! Please come in!***

The money changer charged a small fee and felt the need to apologize excessively.

Back at the Inn, Akodo paid for the lodging **discretely** and informed the party we have a place to stay. 

Gaoxing latches on to the innkeep whose wife died, and now he needs help running his pathetic failing business. Togashi contested this, saying that we needn't concern ourselves with such matters.

Togashi got no sleep that night. In the morning, the innkeep approached Akodo and said that another Lion approached him, and said that Akodo would pay for his stay. How **unlucky**.

Gaoxing played matchmaker for the innkeep. He found a lead on a rice magnate who's been picky about suitors for his daughter. Gaoxing met with this fucking guy and convinced him to marry his daughter to the innkeep.
