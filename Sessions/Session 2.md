summary: The party traveled within Crane lands using papers from Daidoji Kentaro, choosing to sail from Lonely Shore City to Prosperous Plains City on a ship captained by Daidoji Dobunaru. Lodging for the night proved complicated—Akodo quietly paid for the group while Gaoxing involved himself in the innkeep’s personal life, ultimately arranging a marriage alliance for him. After a rough sea voyage, the group arrived in Prosperous Plains and continued on to the estate of Matsu Miyoko, a former rival of Gaoxing’s. There, Gaoxing proposed that his son Doji Junji duel Matsu, and she accepted the challenge to first blood. Junji won the duel.

## Overview

### The Road to the Lonely Shore
We received the papers from [[Bayushi Nagitane]] to adventure into Scorpion territory. We wake up on the 14th day of Doji.

Bayushi's handler tells us that the papers aren't necessarily needed in Scorpion territory. We could book a boat in [[Lonely Shore City]] to [[Prosperous Plains City]]. From there, we could continue to [[Daidoji Haruki]]'s village.

We discussed whether we should take the boat. Ultimately, we decided to take it.

We arrived in Lonely Shore and arrived at the docks around twilight. We find the ship; it's moderately sized. Couldn't go deep ocean, but a little ways out. Couple dozen for the crew.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Gaoxing presents his chop to the captain. The captain is poorly dressed. His name is [[DoNi iobunaru]]. He says we can leave in the morning.

### Figuring Out Lodging
We have to figure out a place to stay for the night. We could stay in an inn and risk dishonor by spending our own money, or we could find a local samurai to lodge us for the night. Akodo said he would fix the problem, and not to worry about it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
He goes to a local samurai named [[Kasugi Heorei]] who does money changes. One of the guards approach him, and asks if he wants to meet the samurai. The door slides open; inside is an elaborately dressed samurai, Kasuga. He's a bit on the heavy side, looks more like a working man rather than a samurai. He comes out grinning, hands wide.

***Welcome master Lion! Please come in!***

The money changer charged a small fee and felt the need to apologize excessively.

Back at the Inn, Akodo paid for the lodging **discretely** and informed the party we have a place to stay. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Gaoxing latches on to the inn, [[Jurō]],keep whose wife died, and now he needs help running his pathetic failing business. Togashi contested this, saying that we needn't concern ourselves with such matters.

Togashi got no sleep that night. In the morning, the innkeep approached Akodo and said that another Lion approached him, and said that Akodo would pay for his stay. How **unlucky**.

Gaoxing played matchmaker for the innkeep. He found a lead on a rice magnate who's been picky about suitors for his daughter. Gaoxing met with this fucking guy and convinced him to marry his daughter to the innkeep.

### Journey in The Prosperous Plains City
We left in the morning. Usagi fuckin barfed from sea sickness. Gaoxing slyly insinuated that one of the fishermen should give him his fishing rod. They were absolutely elated to give it to him. Gaoxing is a menace. 

We approached the Prosperous Plains.

Gaoxing prepared some fish for Akodo and offered him the fishing rod.

### The Estate of Matsu Miyoko
<<<<<<< HEAD
Within the city, Gaoxing shows us around the city. I think he was actually looking to see if he recognized anyone, but he hasn't known anyone in this city in a long time. Eventually, we come across an area with several estates. We enter one with a Lion banner. This is the house of [[Matsu Miyoko]],a woman who once dueled Gaoxing.

Akodo just stopped following once he found some tasty food.

One of the handlers invited us to stay the night.

Soon there was a loud ruckus, and a giant parade bursts through the door with a bunch of Lion bushi. They come to a halt, and the music ceases. Master Matsu stepped forward and addressed Gaoxin.

***"You have grown so much."***

 Gaoxin implies that he wants his son, Junji, to duel her. She accepts, to first blood! Junji managed to draw first blood. They bowed to each other, and she showed her respect to our Crane fellows.
