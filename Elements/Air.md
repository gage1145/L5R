>## Summary
>Air was intuition, because no one could see the air but everyone could feel its effects. It was all the forces that were not seen, the element of storms, subtlety, and unpredictability.
> ## Usage
>As it related to spell effects, Air was used to affect air and wind, sleep, illusions, detection of hidden things, detection of thoughts and feelings, reflexes, and awareness. Also, whereas most spells that required the shugenja's concentration usually required complete or nearly complete focus, Air spells tended to require only a casual level of focus. Asahina Shugenja, Soshi Shugenja and Yogo Shugenja focused mainly on Air.
