>## Summary
>Everything in the world is created from the four elements: [[Air]], [[Earth]], [[Fire]], and [[Water]]. The student of **Void**, however, knows that all things are all four elements, held together by the intangible Void. The element of Void is that which exists outside of and surrounding the other four elements, defining them in its absence as silence defines the musical note it surrounds. This is the nature of the **Realm of Void**.
>## Nature of the Void
>Void, while the most ethereal of the elements, also holds the most potential for power. Void is at once both everywhere and everywhen. Its power is very similar to that of a raging river. It is possible to jump in and still swim safely back to shore, but it is extremely difficult; those who do not give the river their undivided attention and concentration will likely drown instead.
>For this reason, students of Void by necessity must be specialists. Mastering the overwhelming force of the Void requires absolute control and undivided concentration. Any less devotion is a recipe for quick disaster.
