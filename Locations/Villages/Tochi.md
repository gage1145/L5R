## Summary
**Last Glance Castle** (D10) in the [[Toshibu Province]], was the ancestral home of the [[Mirumoto Family]], it was built on a sheer cliff overlooking a pass through [[Great Wall of the North]]. The only road spirals upward through a ravine under the watchful gaze of the castle, and any who wished to visit had to climb the steep, winding path. Invaders had to brave a gauntlet of arrows, pitch and fire from above, with no way to retaliate.
