## Summary
The stalwart Crab are the defenders of Rokugan, responsible for ensuring the Empire's southern border is secure against the demons from the Shadowlands. Centuries of constant warfare against inhuman foes have hardened the Crab into tremendously powerful and brutally practical warriors, but they have little sense of civility or manners. As a result they are often considered crude and barbaric by the other clans.
