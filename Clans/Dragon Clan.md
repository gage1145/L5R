## Summary
Enigmatic and mysterious, the samurai of the Dragon Clan have walked their own path since the Empire was first created. More individualistic and less concerned with material wealth than other clans, the Dragon have much in common with the monks of the [[Brotherhood of Shinsei]], despite the considerable variety among their individual families.

## Lands
Dragon lands are dominated by the Great Wall of the North mountains, and pathways through these mountains are mazelike. Dragon lands in the south begin with the lowlands of the Mirumoto Provinces. Mostly hills and meadows, they contain all of the clan's farms and businesses. The lands culminate in Shiro Mirumoto to the north at the foot of the Great Wall of the North, where all business with the outside world is conducted. Next are the Kitsuki Provinces, also known as the _Gateway to the Wall_, which contain the smallest peaks of the Great Wall with several twisting valleys which can easily confuse visitors. There are a few mining towns and herding villages, but overall it is sparsely populated. To the north of the provinces lies Shiro Kitsuk, the home of the diplomatic corps of the Dragon Clan. Next are the Tamori Provinces, also known as the _Twisting Labyrinth_, which are where the truly isolated parts of Dragon lands begin. There are very few travelers in these parts, and it is barely populated. The Togashi Provinces lie to the northwest.
