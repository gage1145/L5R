## Summary
The Lion Clan is the Right Hand of the Emperor, the defender of his lands and his person, although many times the [[Seppun Family]] family and the Imperial Legions are allowed to stand as poor substitutes (or so the Lion believe). The Lion are militant to a fault and possess the greatest army in the known world. They are feared for their prowess and respected for their unflinchingly honorable natures.
